# This is the "command panel" of the fainD pipeline, where
# input RNAseq experiments may be specified.
# 
# Pipeline expects {_1,_R1, _2, _R2}.fastq affixes and
# can automatically download from SRA. For example, to
# use the HPV-positive RNAseq experiment from SRA with
# the accession number "SRR8250770", then one may use
# the following invocation:
# 
# sequence_files_R1: 
# - "data/raw/reads/SRR8250770_1.fastq"
# sequence_files_R2: 
# - "data/raw/reads/SRR8250770_2.fastq"
# 
# By default, we demonstrate usage with a small RNAseq experiment
sequence_files_R1: 
- "data/raw/reads/demo_R1.fastq"
sequence_files_R2: 
- "data/raw/reads/demo_R2.fastq"
