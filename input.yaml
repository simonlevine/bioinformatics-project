# This is the "command panel" of the fainD pipeline, where
# input (uncompressed) RNAseq experiments may be specified. Simply place the
# the read files into the "data/raw/reads" directory and specify
# the sample name. For example, place the fastq files "library_R1.fastq"
# and "library_R2.fastq" and specify the sample name as:

# sample: "library"

# Pipeline can automatically download from SRA. For example,
# to use the HPV-positive RNAseq experiment from SRA with
# the accession number "SRR8250770", then one may use
# the following invocation:
  
sample: "SRR8250770"

# in this case, there is no need to download sequencing files directly
